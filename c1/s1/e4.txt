Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
	((if (> b 0) + -) a b)

If b is greater than 0, add it to a. If b is less than 0, subtract it from a. This works because subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding its absolute value.
